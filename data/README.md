`model_experimentation.py` - code with original gridsearch implementation with 5 different algorithms and their hyperparameter sets for experimentation. saves a trained linearsvc model + label map between classifications and their encoded versions (`/model/api/optimized_model_labels.sav`) optimized with the best parameters (found using the gridsearch)
