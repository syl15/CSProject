`model_experimentation.py` - code with original gridsearch implementation with 5 different algorithms and their hyperparameter sets for experimentation. saves a trained linearsvc model + label map between classifications and their encoded versions (`/model/api/optimized_model_labels.sav`) optimized with the best parameters (found using the gridsearch)

`generate_unseen_test_data.py` - every time this code is run, it creates a new `final_test.csv` inside of `data/scripts/datasets` with randomly generated unseen data from various databases
