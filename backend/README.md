### Contents of this folder
  - Items you need to create:
    1. `.env`:
      - Stores DB URL, bluesky credentials
      - Contact backend developer for this info
  - `app.py`: Entry point for Flask app.
    - Automatically runs the backend server via `flask run`
    - Optional command `python app.py --reset-db` exists if you want to repopulate the Raw Crisis NLP database. **This is not recommended. Inserting all the training data into the DB takes about 25 minutes.**
  - `database.py`: Allows backend to connect and interact with PostgreSQL tables via SQL queries
  - `populate.py`: Script to populate the Raw Crisis NLP table and handle table resets. **Do not manually run without asking backend dev**
  - `bluesky_poller.py`: Sets up and CRON job for periodially polling bluesky

### First time users
  - [Create a venv](#activating-your-venv)
    - TLDR: 
      - `source [venv_name]/bin/activate` to activate venv
      - `deactivate` to deactivate venv
  - [Run backend/requirements.txt](#installing-new-packages) to download necessary requirements
    - TLDR:
      - `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` to install backend required packages
  - Host the server by running `flask run` in CLI

### Activating your venv 

Aside: Should you activate your venv from the root directory?
  - Actually, a lot of sources are mixed over whether this is the best practice and there are many ways to do it, but you can pick a workflow that works for you. 
  - Activating the venv from the root, however, does make the venv accessible to all the project subfolder which means you won't have to reactivate if you're navigating to specific subfolders. 

If your project is new: 
  - You will need create a new venv
  - Run `python3 -m venv venv` (using whatever python version you have)
  - This creates a `venv` folder in the root directory

Recurring steps (instructions for Mac)
1. Navigate to root directory of the project 
2. To activate, run `source venv/bin/activate` 
3. Install requirements `pip install -r [folderName]/requirements.txt`
    - For example, if I wanted to work in the model folder: 
      - `pip install -r model/requirements.txt`
    - If I wanted to switch to backend work: 
       - `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
    - You only need to do this if dependencies have changed since you last worked on the project (e.g. after pulling new changes)
4. To deactivate, run `deactivate`


If your current venv is corrupted or has conflicting dependencies, you can try deactivating your venv, deleting the old venv and creating a new one. 

`deactivate` (deactivate old venv)  
`rm -rf venv`  (removes the venv directory)  
`python3 -m venv venv` (creates a new venv)  
`pip install -r [folderName]/requirements.txt` (reinstall dependencies)

### Installing new packages 

If you're adding new dependencies, ex. you ran `pip install scikit-learn`,  the current `requirements.txt` won't automatically reflect this change. 

So after installation, freeze the environment to update the list of dependencies by running the following command:

`pip freeze > [folderName]/requirements.txt` 

  Example: `pip freeze > backend/requirements.txt` 

And commit the updated requirements to version control. 

The same goes for if you updated an existing package. 

Alternatively, you can just add the dependency to requirements.txt directly. 


### Using the Flask API routes 

1. Activate your `venv` and install dependencies
2. Run the Flask app \
    `cd backend` \
    `flask run`
3. Run the React app \
    `cd frontend` \
    `npm install` \
    `npm run dev`

You should be able to see the API responses on `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Overivew of API routes

`GET /disasters`
- This is meant to be an overview of all the disasters in our database. It will have less information than the endpoint for each disaster. 
- This has a few optional parameters you can specify. Check out `app.py` for more documentation 
  - limit (how many disasters you want to return)
  - startDate (start date of the disaster)
  - To use a parameter, use the format: 
    - `base_url/disasters?key=value?key=value`, where the parameter name is the `key` 
    - Examples: 
      - `http://127.0.0.1:5001/disasters` (returns all) 
      - `http://127.0.0.1:5001/disasters?limit=2` (returns first two)
      - `http://127.0.0.1:5001/disasters?startDate=2024-01-01` 

`GET /disasters/id` 
- This will contain additional information about each disaster, including posts (currently limited to returning a max of 10)
- No other parameters are available  
- You must specify a valid id to get back a disaster 
- Examples: 
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5001/disasters/23` (returns disaster with disaster_id=23)

`GET /disasters/recent` 
- Returns the most recent disaster, with all the metadata and posts 
- No other parameters are available
